=============
## My code was reviewed by LukasSob (ID: 25728866), Nathan Edwards (ID: 25725278), 
## Samuel Jonathan Orman-Chan (ID: 25659005) and Stevie Goodman (ID: 25175912)
The most frequent comments when it came to my code where about my unsimplified Regex Filters and 
lack of commenting. I took onboard all the comments in these reviews and tweaked my code to reflect this.
Other features I implemented due to review was displaying the retrieved text from the used textfile, 
allow program rerun and closing as choices and moving a bit of program.cs into input.cs to improve abstraction.
